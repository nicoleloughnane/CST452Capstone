# CST452Capstone
My CST 452 Senior Capstone Project at Grand Canyon University called Daily Faith Journal built with the MEVN stack (MongoDB, Express, Vue, and Node) is set to be complete by the middle of April 2023
Users will be able to create journal entries and record sermon notes taken a church through a convenient online platform. It will be accessible and responsive through the web browser on either computer or mobile device. 
In CST 451 (semester 1 of senior capstone) we planned out the architecture of the project and researched how we would go about its completion.
